<Typography variant="h4">Html Data Attributes and Customization</Typography>
<br/>
<Typography variant="body1">
All LensUi components have a `data-lens-element` attribute as well as its internal elements that make up a component.
Making use of these selectors you can perform more selective customization by css.
</Typography>
<br/>

**TIP:** _You can just do an inspect element in your browser to seed selectors structure._

**See an example of how to perform this customization:**
```css

.myCustomCardsContainer [data-lens-element="card"] {
  width: 200px;
}
/* você conseque selection elemetros filhos que compõe o componente*/
.myCustomCardsContainer [data-lens-element="card"] [data-lens-element="card_body"] {
  padding: 5rem;
}

```

```tsx
<div className="myCustomCardsContainer">
  <Card>
    <Card.Body>
      Hello world
    </Card.Body>
  </Card>
</div>
```

### CSS Variables
_In the near future we will be simplifying theme settings and implementing a visual tool for customizing themes._
<Typography variant="body1">
Here is a list of css variables and their default values, you can see the reflection of these changes in real time.
